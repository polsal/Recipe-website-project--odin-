    <p><strong> Steps  </strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>    wash the rice like your mother used to wash you untill the water runs clear  </li>
        <li>    Now let the rice rest  and soak in its bath tub for 30 mins  </li>
        <li>    Now unplug the little drainer in the bath tub and watch the fear enter the rice's eyes as it wakes up from its rest . But don't be rude and let it dry of in its strainer </li>
        <li>   Get a pan add the cumin oil and most importantly ( again <strong>thank you boris</strong> )  ADD THE BAY LEAF </li>
        <li>   FRY the mixture but do net let the cumin burn i am watching you garry dont let it burn again  </li>
        <li>    Now chop the onions and add them to the mixture add 1/4 tbsp of salt as well and fry untill onion is soft</li>
        <li>    Chop the  ginger, garlic and add them to the micture frying  on medium to medium-low heat for about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>    Now chop the carrots into cubes  and green beans into 1/2 inch long peices . Fry the vegetables on medium heat for about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>    Then add the  rice, garam masala, salt and fry for another 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
        <li>    Now Add the water and frozen green peas. Bring the water to a vigorous boil. </li>
        <li>    Once the water starts to boil, cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat to low. </li>
        <li>    Cook on low heat until the rice is cooked. </li>
        <li>    Once the rice is cooked, uncover the pan and cook to remove moisture for a couple of seconds  </li>
        <li>    Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>    Add the roasted cashews and mix it VERY GENTLY to prevent the the rice grains from breaking. </li>
        <li>    DO NOT OVER MIX THE RICE OTHERWISE IT WILL TURN MUSHY. </li>
        <li>    <em> allow it to rest for 2-3 mins before serving allow it to rest with the lid covered</em> </li>
